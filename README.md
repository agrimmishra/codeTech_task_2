Job Satisfaction and Work-Life Balance: Metrics on employee satisfaction levels and work-life balance trends.
Performance Analysis: Evaluation of employee performance, promotions, and training effectiveness.
Compensation Insights: Visualizations of salary distributions, trends, and comparisons.
Training and Development: Analysis of training hours and their impact on employee performance.
**Tools Used**
**Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Python (Optional): For initial data preprocessing and analysis**.
**Microsoft Excel/CSV: Source of raw HR data.
